== DIRECTORIES ==

www/			- The website root directory
www/javascript/	- Javascript code
sql/			- SQL creation script
php/			- PHP code
php/pages/		- PHP code which generates HTML body


== INSTALLATION ==

The website was created using the software available in the labs: MySQL 5,
PHP 4.4.9. It does not use any external frameworks, so it should just work
anywhere those technologies are available.


== SHELL SCRIPTS ==

A few simple shell scripts were used to speed up development:

db.sh 			- connect to the database using our groups credentials
updatedb.sh 	- run "sql/creationScript.sql" to reinitialize the original data
updateweb.sh 	- updates the web space (requires group access)
