	<p class="bodycopy">The flexible organization of J.P.Peach &amp; Associates allows us to offer a 
	wide range of services at a significant cost savings compared to other software companies. We 
	are a collection of independent contractors and keep our overhead cost low by not maintaining 
	a bricks-and-mortar location.</p> 
	<br />
	<a name="Application" class="header1">Desktop Application Development</a>
	<p class="bodycopy">J.P.Peach &amp; Associates can provide development and support for applications 
	in the Windows environment, PalmOS and internet-based applications. We have been developing 
	customized applications for IBM compatible computers since the early days of DOS and have 
	extensive experience with all versions of Windows. While we have developed a large number of 
	general purpose applications, we also specialize in database, data collection and engineering 
	analysis applications. The choice of programming languages can have a significant effect on 
	the cost and functionality of an application. We can develop or modify your existing programs 
	using C++, Java, FORTRAN, Visual Basic, SQL, ODBC, DAO, ADO. If you do not need an entire 
	application but require an ActiveX or dll to increase the functionality of your application, 
	we can do that too.</p>
	<br />
	<a name="PDA" class="header1">PDA Application Development</a>
	<p class="bodycopy">There has been a recent boom in the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) 
	and J.P.Peach &amp; Associates has kept pace. We can develop customized applications that will 
	run on your PalmOS or WinCE-based PDA. These devices are more then just a replacement for your old paper 
	appointment book. They have a powerful processor inside them and a sophisticated programming 
	language that allows them to do most things that your desktop computer can do. With customized 
	applications and conduits we can integrate PDAs into your corporate databases and network.</p>
	<br />
	<a name="WebDevelopment" class="header1">Web Development</a>
	<p class="bodycopy">In 1997 we expanded our services to include web design and development. Projects can
	be as small as a couple of static web pages. We 
	can also develop sophisticated cgi scripts to manage your databases and provide the front and back-end 
	for large corporate web sites or even portals. In addition to designing the &quot;corporate look&quot; and graphics 
	for your site we can also write scripts that would allow users to log-into your site and search databases 
	for information that is of interest to them. If you need more functionality then what HTML and 
	Javascript can provide we can write custom Java applets to meet your needs. J.P.Peach &amp; Associates 
	is a full-service web design and development company because we also provide hosting and maintenance 
	services. In addition, we do not use HTML code generators because they produce a poor quality HTML page 
	that is slow to download and difficult to change. We code all of our HTML by hand for increased speed 
	and performance on any browser.</p>
	<br />
	<a name="GraphicDesign" class="header1">Graphic Design</a>
	<p class="bodycopy">Designing images for the web is a special skill and we have the talent.  Simply scanning 
	an image and putting it on a web site often leads to poor results.  The artist needs to adjust the colors,
	resolution, contrast and much more in order to create an image that will render properly on the wide variety of
	browsers and platforms that are being used.  The design team can do more than web based graphics. Our 
	graphic artist can develop animations, corporate themes, brochure layouts and posters and logo designs.</p>
	<br />
	<a name="WebHosting" class="header1">Web Hosting</a>
	<p class="bodycopy">Our company and web hosting are built on flexibility.  Over the years
	we have used a large number of web hosting services, from the cheap to the expensive, and have never been really
	happy with any of them.  They forced us into a &quot;hosting package&quot; that never really fit our client's 
	needs.  So, we decided to set up our own server so that we can have full control over it.  If you want to 
	host your site with us we will customize the services and software to fit your needs.  We have &quot;hosting packages&quot;
	but they are only a starting point, we will customize the hosting services to meet your specific needs.</p>
